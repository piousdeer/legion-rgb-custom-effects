My keyboard lighting effects for Lenovo Legion laptops. Use with [Legion RGB Control](https://github.com/4JX/L5P-Keyboard-RGB).

- wake.json: sends a simple white wave right, then left, non-looping. I have this set up to play on boot and wake up.
- cyber.json: Cyberpunk 2077-inspired long looping animation 
- cyber-short.json: short non-looping slower version of cyber.json
